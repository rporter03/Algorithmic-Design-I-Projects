# Algorithmic-Design-I-Projects

Hello! This repository contains small projects that I have designed while taking Algorithmic Design I at the University of South Carolina.
Below are brief descriptions as to what each project does.

== Choose Your Own Path Adventure ==
This project is a short game with a story that the user can control by making decisions. Each decision will have a different outcome, so choose wisely, or explore each option!

== Circle Data ==
This program allows the user to enter the radii of however many circles they want and the program will calculate the area of each circle. The user has the options to sort the data of the circles by smallest to largest, largest to smallest, and even display the circles that have unique areas and radii. Additionally, the user also has the option to view the data in the same order they inputted it as.

== Matrix Addition ==
This program calculates the addition of two matrices. The user can enter the number of columns and rows for two matrices, along with the values of their corresponding position within the matrix. 

== Military Time Converter ==
This program allows the user to convert military time to the 12 hour clock time format. The program asks the user to enter the hours, minutes, and seconds of the military time individually first. Then, the program allows the user to enter the military time in the format 00:00:00. 

== Rock Paper Scissors ==
This is a simple game of rock paper scissors with three rounds against the computer. This program utilizes a RNG to make the computer's move. After three rounds are played, the program will display the outcome as either a player victory, computer victory, or a tie.
